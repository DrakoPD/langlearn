# langlearn

> Let's practice! 
So, you are here looking for some practice, let;s begin then, in this project there are lots of ideas you can use to practice some programming, in any lang you want, you can even propose more challenges if you want or modify others projects.

So, in order to keep everything organized and gice credit to every coder we will not only mantain a special code structure but also a file that will server the porpuse of being our _database_ of participation. remember that you need a github account to participate.

## Structure of the repo

+ langlearn
  + project
    + lang
      + contributor
        + `files`

It's quite simple, just keep that format and we will be allrigt, just one more thing, you need to add a readme file in your repo so everyone knows exactly what are you pursuing with your personal project. Feel free to do as you please, it does not need to be just like other projects in that folder, or have the same goals.

## `CONTRIBUTORS.md` format

Ok, basically the format that we will respect in the contributors file is a markdown file like so:

> \# contributors
>
> \#\# _{Project}_
>
> \#\#\# _{Lang}_
>
> \#\#\#\# _{contributor}_
>
> _decription and goal of the project_
>
> \> {other} {contributors} {names}
>
> \#\#\#\# _{contributor II}_
>
> _decription and goal of the project of contributor II_
>
> \> {other} {contributors} {names}
>
